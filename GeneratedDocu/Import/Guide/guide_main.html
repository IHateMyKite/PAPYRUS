        Device minigames are a more immersive rework of the way escaping devices works in Devious Devices. <br>
        
        While the original aproach in Devious Devices was to just have a random number generator decide on the outcome of an unlocking attempt, the         
        Unforgiving Devices approach is to give the player <b>more options</b> and higher <b>participation/immersion</b> when trying to escape a device. <br>
        In addition, every custom device type can also have it's own custom minigame, allowing for a unique approach when trying to escape from it. <br>
        
        <h2> How to escape a device? </h2>

        Same as in Devious Devices, there are basically three things you can try, when a device is locked onto you and you want to get rid of it.
        You can  <br>  <br>
        1.  Try to <b>open the locks</b> of the device (if there is any lock at all). <br>
        2.  Try to <b>struggle out of it</b>, by moving your body and trying to simply slip out of what is holding you. <br>
        3.  Try to <b>cut the device</b>, by rubbing against a sharp edge, like the sharpest weapon you have in inventory.  <br>
        <br>

        <h2> Default minigame structure</h2>

        While the minigame can be a bit confusing at first glance, the basic structure is this:<br>
        The main character enters into an animation scene, and either magicka, health or stamina will be drained (or multiple of those) as the player character is straining to get out of the selected device.<br>
        The device also has statistics like health and condition, which will also be drained. <br>
        <b>Once the player cannot continue</b> due to spent magicka, health or stamina, this attempt at getting out of the device is over, and the device stays on.<br>
        <b>Once the device statistics (condition or health) go to zero</b>, this attempt at getting out of the decice is over, and the player character gets out of the device.<br>
        Even if the player character had to stop due to spent magicka, health or stamina, there may be still some damage already done to the device, and the next attempt will have a better starting point.  
        But of course, you will have to recover magicka, stamina or health first and an additional cooldown before the next attempt may also apply.<br>
      
        <br>
        While waiting for stamina/magicka/health to drain during the minigame and while waiting for the device statistics to deteriorate as well, 
        occasionally the main character will light up while the minigame animation is playing, usually in blue or green color.
        Once that happens, the press the magic key (A by default) in case of a blue flash or alternatively the stamina key (D by default).
        If this happens in time with the flash, this will be considered a <b>critical hit</b>.<br>
        Critical hits can do a variety of things.  They may add extra damage to the device.  They may help you recover some of your drained health/magicka/stamina.  Or they may allow to open a lock with your key.  Or to enter into the lockpicking scene for lockpicking attempts.
        Opening a lock with an appropriate key will require at least one successful critical hit, to get the key into the lock.<br>
        This minigame structure will be used in various ways, during all escape attempts.
    

        <h2> Opening device locks</h2>

        If you <b>go for the locks</b>, you should either have a matching key or bring a stash of lockpicks.  The device in question can have multiple locks and each of them can be protected by additional shields. <br>
        Before even starting the lockpicking, a minigame will be started and you have to place a critical hit in the minigame (explained below) to get your lockpick (or key) into the lock.  Only once that is done, you will proceed to the actual lockpicking.
        Note, that in this lockpicking game, you can only use 2 of your lockpicks on a given lock.  Once these two lockpicks are used up, you will have to place a fresh critical hit in the minigame in order to continue picking the lock.
        Locks change however after each 2 lockpicks, so the <b>lockpicking is much harder when tring to pick the lock of a device you are wearing</b> than when trying to open a chest lock of the same grade.   <br>
        A  <b>shield</b> added to the lock can be removed in much the same way:  Winning a lockpicking scene after landing a critical hit will just remove the shield. <br>
        Once all the shields are removed and all the locks are open, the device will finally come off and you will be free again. <br>
        Of course some tricky and unique devices may require a special unique key and have no way of picking them.  Some devices may also feature time-locks (so that the lock in not availabe for picking or opening with a key before a certain time has passed). 
        And some may require other pre-conditions first.  Finally, some devices might not even have locks.  In those cases no options for locks will be available.



        <h2> Cutting a device open</h2>

        Many devices can simply be cut open.  This sounds easy and straightforward, and sometimes it is.  The cutting minigame follows a somewhat similar pattern.
        Stamina will drain from the player character and while there is stamina left, the player can try to cut the device as much as possible.
        A cutting meter will be displayed on the right.  Try to press the special key (S by default) when the cutting meter is almost full, in order to land an effective mini-cut as often as possible.
        This should make the device lose health.  If in addition the main character flashes up in the usual blue resp. green color, press A resp. D keys to land an additional critical hit, which will do extra cutting damage and might get you to your goal much quicker.


        <h2> Struggling out of a device </h2>
        
        If the locks and cutting are not good options, maybe simply struggling ouf of the device will do.  There are five ways to approach this: <br>  <br>
        1.  <b><font color="green"></b> A regular attempt </font><br>
        2.  An attempt <b><font color="red">using all your strength</font></b>. <br>
        3.  An attempt <b><font color="blue">using magic</font></b> <br>
        4.  Struggling effortlessly <br>
        5.  Strugge uselessly <br>
        <br>
        
        <b><font color="green"> A regular attempt</font></b> will just drain stamina.  You can place critical hits in the minigame in the same way as above.  It may not be the most effective way to get out of severe bondage, but in some cases it will already do.
        Success in this attempt is tied to pickpocketing skill.  Detailed damage stats can be found in the Appendix section below under the headline 'default minigame'.<br>
        <br>
        An attempt <b><font color="red">using all your strength</font></b> will drain stamina as well as health.  Be careful.  Especially in combination with devices, that deliver little electric shocks it's possible to kill yourself in the process, so watch your health as well.
        Success in this attempt is tied to Two-handed weapon skill.  Detailed damage stats can be found in the Appendix section below under the headline 'desperate struggle'.<br>
        <br>
        An attempt <b><font color="blue">using magic</font></b> will drain stamina as well as magicka.  
        Success in this attempt is tied to destruction magic skill.  Detailed damage stats can be found in the Appendix section below under the headline 'magicka strugge'.<br>
        <br>
        An attempt at <b>struggling but doing so efforlessly</b> will not drain your stamina or other statistics in meaningfull ways.  
        But struggle progress will also be very limited with most devices.  You can always use the E key (by default) to exit out of this attempt, if it's not getting you anywhere.  Detailed damage stats can be found in the Appendix section below under the headline 'slow strugge'.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, in some cases <b>struggling uselessly</b> will be an option.  As the name implies, this won't help in any way, usually because the device is not of the kind that can be struggled out from.
        But if you really want to try, you have the option to do it.  
        <br>

        <h2> Accessibility of devices </h2>

        When trapped in a lot of devious bondage devices at the same time, things can get complicated.
        For example the nipple piercings might be a bother due to them manifesting other devices, so you would like to get rid of them asap.
        However, when they are hidden below the locked chastity bra, which you are also wearing, you may not be able to do anything about the piercings, because their <b>accessibility</b> is low (or zero).
        In this case it makes sense to work on other devices first, like the bra.  And once that has come off, the piercings will be availabe again.
        With some special plugs of the more unforgiving kind, accessibility can become quite an issue even if the plug is the only devious device left on you.
        In some cases you need to wait for the right time, when the plug has shiftes, such that you can finally grasp it and get it removed. 

        <h2> Selecting which device to work on </h2>

        When caught up in multiple devious bondage devices, it may make sense to proceed strategically. <br>
        The . key (well, that depends on our keyboard layout, check the sample layout under controls to see the standard layout and just try some) will bring up the currently selected device. <br>
        Pressing the same key for longer (at least a second), will bring up the overview of all unforgiving devices you are currently wearing.  
        The currently selected device will be usually be shown as the top position in that list.  (I.e. it may show up twice in the list, don't get confused, this is normal.)
        By pressing the W and S keys, you should be able to navigate up and down the list to select any UD item you want to work on next.
        This is espeically useful since in some cases, you may not be able to access your inventory due to some heavy bondage.
